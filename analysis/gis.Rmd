# Geographic Information Systems

> **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**: computer based systems used to:  

> - collect

- display 
spatial or geographic data

In science, GIS allow us to examine spatial realationships, patterns and processes. 

Applied to a broad range of phenomena: from physical, biological to cultural and demographic.


# spatial data types

Most common spatial data types:

- **raster:** gridded data
- **vector:** geographical feautures
    - points
    - lines
    - polygons

Vector data tends to dominate the social sciences because human settlements tend to have discrete borders.

Raster often dominates in environmental sciences because of the reliance on remote sensing data.

There is much overlap in some fields and raster and vector datasets can be used side-by-side: ecologists and demographers, for example, commonly use both vector and raster data. 

## data + spatial metadata

Ultimately they are just **data with geographic metadata attached** to it in a structured way that both locates the data and also makes it interoperable. 
One of the most important aspects of this georgraphic metadata is the **Coordinate Reference System** being used.

# Coordinate Reference Systems

Coordinate reference systems (GCS) use a **spheroid** to approximate the surface of the earth and define locations on it. 

A spheroid is a three-dimensional shape created from a two-dimensional ellipse. The ellipse is an oval, with a major axis (the longer axis) and a minor axis (the shorter axis). Spheroid are used to and distinguished from another by the lengths of these two axes.

## Types of common coordinate systems

There are two types of Coordinate Reference Systems:

- **Geographic coordinate system (GCS)**: A global or spherical coordinate system such as latitude-longitude. 
- **Projected coordinate systems (PCS)**: A projected coordinate system provide various mechanisms to project maps of the earth's spherical surface onto a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate plane. Projected coordinate systems are referred to as map projections.

Coordinate systems (both geographic and projected) provide a framework for defining real-world locations.


## Geographic Coordinate System

Geographic Coordinate Systems are defined by a **Datum**

A **Datum** is a particular model of the shape of the earth.

It has:  

- **angular units (eg. degrees)** 
- defines a **starting point** (i.e. where is (0,0) in particular which longitude is defined to be 0°?), so the angles reference a meaningful spot on the earth.
- defines the **position of the spheroid relative to the center** of the earth and therefore the origin and orientation of latitude and longitude lines.

**A point is referenced by its longitude and latitude values.** Longitude and latitude are angles measured from the earth's center to a point on the earth's surface.

### The right datum for the right job

A particular datum can be selected for use in a specific geographic area, because it does a good job of modelling the surface of the earth in that part of the world.

> Orange Peel Analogy: a datum is your choice of fruit to use in the orange peel analogy.  Is the earth an orange, a lemon, a lime, a grapefruit?

### Common Datums 

- [**WGS 84 - the World Geodetic System of 1984:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) The WGS 84 datum is the only world referencing system in place today. WGS 84 is the default standard datum for coordinates stored in recreational and commercial GPS units.
- [**NAD 83 - The North American Datum of 1983:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Datum) is the datum now used to define the geodetic network in North America


#### Geographic (datum) transformations

To change between geographic coordinate system, you may need to perform a **geographic (datum) transformation**. This is a well-defined mathematical method to convert coordinates between two geographic coordinate systems. 


## Projected coordinate systems (PCS)

Projected coordinate systems include **a projection**

A Projection is a mathematical transformation of the angular measurements on a round earth to a flat surface (i.e. paper or a computer screen).

Units of measurement are linear, usually meters.


> Orange Peel Analogy: a projection is how you peel your orange and then flatten the peel.

### Common projected coordinate systems:

-[**Mercator projection:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection) a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical purposes because of its ability to represent lines of constant course as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians.

- [**Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system): The UTM system is not a single map projection. The system instead divides the Earth into **sixty zones**, each being a **six-degree band of longitude**, and uses a secant transverse Mercator projection in each zone. 

- [**Albers Equal Area**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albers_projection): a conic, equal area map projection that uses two standard parallels. Although scale and shape are not preserved, distortion is minimal between the standard parallels.

#### Q: Why is WGS 84 so different to other three projected maps?

Latitude lines are concentric circles that become smaller near the poles. They form a single point at the poles.

When a lat/lon crs is flattened, it does not take this into accout, resulting in increasing distortion of features as one approaches the poles.

#### Q: Why do the three projected maps differ from each other?

Going back to the orange peel analogy, different projections use a different starting point and method to peel the earth's surface into a flat surface.

#### Map reprojections

To change between projected CRSs you need to **reproject** your data. This often involves unprojecting back to lat/lon, transforming the unprojected coordinates and then reprojecting.

# Notation for Coordinate Reference Systems in R

You have two options for identifying a CRS in most R commands.  The documentation for a command that requires projection information will tell you which is required.  Often you can choose between the two options.

## EPSG Code

An EPSG (European Petroleum Survey Group) Code is an ID that has been assigned to most common projections to make reference to a particular projection easy.  An EPSG Code is also called an SRID (Spatial Reference Identifier).  Technically, EPSG is the authority that assigns SRIDs, but you will hear these terms used interchangibly.

### pros/cons

The main advantages to using this method of specifying a projection are that it is standardized and ensures you have the same parameters every time.  

The disadvantage is that if you need to know the parameters used by the projection or it's name, you have to look them up, but that's fairly easy to to at [spatialreference.org](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/).  Also, you can't customize the parameters if you use an EPSG code. 

## PROJ.4 String

PROJ.4 is an open source library for defining and converting between coordinate reference systems.  It defines a standard way to write projection parameters.  

For example, the proj.4 string: `+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0` encodes:

- **proj=longlat:** the data are in a geographic (latitude and longitude) coordinate system
- **datum=WGS84:** the datum WGS84 (the datum refers to the 0,0 reference for the coordinate system used in the projection)
- **ellps=WGS84:** the ellipsoid (how the earth’s roundness is calculated) is WGS84

_Note that there are no specified units above. This is because this geographic coordinate reference system is in latitude and longitude which is most often recorded in decimal degrees._

### pros/cons

Two important advantages to using this option are:

1. the parameters are human-readable and immediately transparent 
2. the strings are easily customized.  

The main disadvantage to this option is that it's easy to make a mistake when you reproduce the string, accidentally changing parameters.

### The most common mistake to beware of:

You may find yourself in a situatation were you'll need to tell your GIS (in our case R) what the projection/CRS of your data should be.  In these cases, the GIS needs to know what the projection/CRS **currently** is, not what you would like it to be.  If you need to change a projection, you need to go through a different process, often called Re-project or Transform.




## A motivating example 
#### (from Geocomputation in R, [Section 2.1](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html#vector-data)):

The city of London can be represented by the coordinates c(-0.1, 51.5). This means that its location is **-0.1 degrees east** and **51.5 degrees north** of the **origin**. The origin in this case is at 0 degrees longitude (the Prime Meridian) and 0 degree latitude (the Equator) in a geographic (‘lon/lat’) coordinate system (GCS). 

![](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/figures/vector_lonlat.png)

The same point could also be approximated in a **PCS** with **‘Easting/Northing’ values of c(530000, 180000)** in the **British National Grid (BNG)**, meaning that London is located 530 km East and 180 km North of the origin of the CRS (right panel).

The location of BNG’s origin, in the sea beyond South West Peninsular, ensures that most locations in the UK have positive Easting and Northing values.
