## Workshop approach
    
### Rstudio

We will be working in an Rstudio project. I recommend this workflow for all your projects because it keeps your work portable and self contained

We will also be using Rmd notebooks. I like them because you can see the outputs of code as you write. You can also make notes around your code using markdown. _See further resources for more details._ 

### Live coding

The majority of the workshop I will be live coding `r emo::ji("fearful")` so that you can follow along. You will get a lot more out of the workshop if you do.
